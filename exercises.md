What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
I mainly write long fantasy fiction novels.

What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Google docs

Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
Because it is simple and allows me to write a story on my own.

How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
Due to the nature of prose fiction certain action sequences are not as exciting or visceral compared to visual mediums such as animation or comics. It facilitates my writing by allowing me as a writer to instead focus more on the characters and delve deeper into the psychology of the characters mind.




week 10
who is the audience of your creative work?
i believe a majoirty of the audience will be people already familiar with inform  7 as the software has a specific stlye of play that will be unfamilar to those not in tune with the software. there may be a subset of people who will stumble across the work becuase of its themes and ideas but i predict that will be the minority unless the work achieves a high level of exposure outside of the interactive fiction community

how does the the audience affect your work?
i think having an audience of inform 7 users will affect how i approach the story as i will try to subvert thier expectations. im not too familar wiht interactive fiction  as a genre but ive noticed some common themes and i will try to surprise those who have a lot of  expirence with the medium. in terms of the themes of the piece
i wil defintely try to potray the ideas of domestic violence as faithfully and repsctfully as possible.
