Readings 

Week 1

What is electronic literature ?
Electronic has an interesting history starting out with simple hypertext fiction and eventually evolving into several different styles and genres. Two of the genres most prominent are generative art and interactive fiction. Interactive fiction is the style that I am personally most interested in as I play a degree of video games. Games and interactive fiction are similar in a lot of ways and  the piece lists some ways that digital mediums can enhance storytelling such as through the usage of visuals, animations and graphics. Generative art is also an interesting tool as it uses algorithms to randomly generate pieces of poetry and  writing . While generative art is interesting I don't believe I will engage in it as much in this class as I don't find it as fun or interesting as interactive fiction. 



Week 2

Shade reading 
This reading made me understand how shade utilized and subverted genre expectations. In particular the emphasis on light was an intriguing point of discussion. Douglass examines how light is often utilized in other works of interactive fiction and discusses how shade utilizes light not only as a narrative element but also as subverts certain ideas about light as the player embraces the darkness rather than having the darkness kill them.
The reading made me appreciate shade more as a work of fiction and made me want to go back and experience the game as whole although now that I know how it ends it might be useful to have a guide with me. While I understand the difficult nature of the game to be intentional and to reflect the characters mindset, I found it frustrating to play with and I believe that my inform 7 piece will be a lot less difficult to navigate.



Week 7

This piece drew a comparison between video games and poetry and discussed how they were similar in certain ways. It discusses how video games are a language in that the video game form graphics, animation art , storytelling are all aspects of the language itself and this is similar to poetry in which other aspects independent of the text itself such as rhyme sound symbolism etc are taken in as part of the language. The piece also discusses why videogames are more popular than poetry in that games provide entertainment and guide the audience rather than acting like an authority. The piece also mentions the diversity of video games as opposed to poetry. I think a lot of what the price said was intuitively true, especially about how video games are simply more entertaining and also have a myriad of different ways of drawing in an audience independent of simply good storytelling.




Week 10 white supremacy  

Ikeda's piece on white supremacy as a structural system in electronics literature is an insightful read. It draws on many ideas of critical race theory and systemic racism arguing that the structure of electronic literature is imbued with white supremacists attitudes. Through this lens they evaluate some of the effects that this has on the field of electronic literature and attempt to change this current normative view of the medium. I found this piece interesting as it drew on many of the themes of critical race analysis in which participants attempt to view certain structures and institutions through the lens of race, whether it be the educational system, judicial system or the media. Ikeda focuses her lens on electronic literature and discusses some of the ways that technology utilized in electronic media can be harmful in terms of representing people of color. The example of the search engines was interesting and argues that search engines dont supply objective data but instead is imbued with the values of the intelligence class which lacks significant representation and this objectifies people of color. I found their overall critique similar to other ideas I encountered such as the idea of antiracism and a rejection of colorblindness. Only a few years ago people had the notion that to end racism we had to treat race as if fit does not exist. That notion however has resulted in injust systems such as the United states police department. It is therefore necessary from Ikeda's viewpoint that we actively discuss and bring down old structures of white supremacy rather than simply accept it.















What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

Shade is unique in terms of its interactive nature. It feels much more like a video game than the other works and I think it comes down to the fact that it allows the players to directly type what they want the character to do.

How are those elements meaningful?

It's meaningful because it positions the readers directly into the role of the player and allows for an extra layer of immersion.


How are the works read differently from print literature?

Shade would be extremely different in print media and it would defeat the purpose of the medium which is to allow players to choose not only what they do but in which order they do it.


How is electronic literature different from print literature?

It's different because in the case with shade it puts more emphasis on reader choice. Other words such as Taroko gorge are reliant on auto generated texts which can be replicated to a certain extent although the method is a bit more tedious. I believe electronic  literature is different from print media in that the vast majority try to engage in reader choice which contrasts with print media in which oftentimes reader's choice is rarely emphasized.



What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

I think by the strictest definition whether or not it is published on a digital medium but perhaps from a more artistic standpoint it would be works that allow the player to have a certain degree of interactivity and choice. However even that definition is not entirely true as their works such as the vine and the fish that are more akin to a traditional webcomic.



How is hypertext fiction different from fiction?

Hypertext fiction differs from traditional fiction in that it allows players/readers to choose which aspect of the story they want to discover next. Oftentimes hypertext fiction is non linear due to this aspect of player choice. 


How is it different from games?

That's a hard question. It gets into a deeper philosophical question of what makes something a game and what doesn't. I personally believe hypertext fiction is a game just a type of game that does not utilize the mechanics of gameplay to its highest effect. This can happen a lot of times in different mediums. For example, are marvel movies really cinema? They might be in the traditional sense in that they are screened in theaters and marketed as movies but in terms of artistic qualities, certain people(Scorsese) don't view it as traditional cinema mainly because it doesn't emphasize the qualities of cinema and instead emphasizes more spectacle and entertainment(just my opinion by the way) . In a similar way I think hypertext fiction is technically a game but it doesn't emphasize gameplay mechanics rather it utilizes a very simple gameplay mechanic in order to emphasize the storytelling. 

How do you plan fiction?


There are as many ways to plan fiction as there are humans on the planet. Everyone has different ways of planning fiction but there are some general guidelines such as plot, characters, themes. However I believe as much as we try to pin down exactly how to plan fiction most of the idea generation is very mysterious. A Lot of times it just happens and even the author doesn't really know how they came up with it. 

How could you plan hypertext fiction?

Due to the nature of hypertext fiction I believe it does require more meticulous planning than traditional fiction as the author has to take into account which specific hyperlinks can be accessed and which scenes the player has access to. Though in terms of idea generation it follows a very similar model to any other form of fiction or writing in general 




What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
I mainly write long fantasy fiction novels.

What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Google docs

Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
Because it is simple and allows me to write a story on my own.

How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
Due to the nature of prose fiction certain action sequences are not as exciting or visceral compared to visual mediums such as animation or comics. It facilitates my writing by allowing me as a writer to instead focus more on the characters and delve deeper into the psychology of the characters mind.




week 10
who is the audience of your creative work?
i believe a majoirty of the audience will be people already familiar with inform  7 as the software has a specific stlye of play that will be unfamilar to those not in tune with the software. there may be a subset of people who will stumble across the work becuase of its themes and ideas but i predict that will be the minority unless the work achieves a high level of exposure outside of the interactive fiction community

how does the the audience affect your work?
i think having an audience of inform 7 users will affect how i approach the story as i will try to subvert thier expectations. im not too familar wiht interactive fiction  as a genre but ive noticed some common themes and i will try to surprise those who have a lot of  expirence with the medium. in terms of the themes of the piece
i wil defintely try to potray the ideas of domestic violence as faithfully and repsctfully as possible.
