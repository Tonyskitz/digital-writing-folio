week 10
who is the audience of your creative work?
i believe a majoirty of the audience will be people already familiar with inform  7 as the software has a specific stlye of play that will be unfamilar to those not in tune with the software. there may be a subset of people who will stumble across the work becuase of its themes and ideas but i predict that will be the minority unless the work achieves a high level of exposure outside of the interactive fiction community

how does the the audience affect your work?
i think having an audience of inform 7 users will affect how i approach the story as i will try to subvert thier expectations. im not too familar wiht interactive fiction  as a genre but ive noticed some common themes and i will try to surprise those who have a lot of  expirence with the medium. in terms of the themes of the piece
i wil defintely try to potray the ideas of domestic violence as faithfully and repsctfully as possible.
